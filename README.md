# Practicing C plus plus

In this project we are relearning cpp but using the newest features from the language like smart pointers and such.
This project will including OOP and fetching and decoding data from a weather api. We are using open sourced libraries to read the json files.
The main purpose is to learn smart pointers and not have any memory leaks by using scope dealloc and such.



## Classes 




## Implemenations



## Future
For the future I do plan on implementing this CLI app into a qt application just to learn more about gui programming. Later on we will implement this application using rust or zig to make it memory safe.
